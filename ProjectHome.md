imbi is an effort to create a BI solution using the imdb data set (http://www.imdb.com/interfaces).

The purpose of this project is simply to have a means to host all kinds of source file and have source code versioning.

The current focus is for the members of the imbi google group to learn working with open source BI tools, and as a secondary purpose to experiment with collaborative tools like google groups and this google code site.
